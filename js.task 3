Part 1 – Logical & Ternary Operator

Q1: Check whether a number is between 10 and 50 using logical AND.
Input: let num = 25
Output: "Valid Number" or "Invalid Number"

Answer:

let num = 25;
if (num >= 10 && num <= 50) {
  console.log("Valid Number");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid Number");
}
output :valid Number
Explanation:
Since 25 is greater than 10 and less than 50, both conditions are true.

Q2: Check if a user is eligible to log in.
Condition:
username must be "admin"
password must be "1234"
Use logical AND.

Answer:
let username = "admin";
let password = "1234";
if (username === "admin" && password === "1234") {
  console.log("Login Successful");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid Login");
}

Output:
Login Successful
Explanation:
Both username and password match, so login is allowed.

Q3: Using ternary operator:
Check if a number is even or odd

Answer:
let n = 7;
console.log(n % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd");

Output:
Odd
Explanation:
7 is not divisible by 2, so it is odd.

Q4: What is the output?
console.log((10 === "10") || (5 > 2) && !(3 < 1));
Explain step by step.

Output:
true
Explanation:
10 === "10" is false.
5 > 2 is true.
3 < 1 is false and NOT makes it true.
So true AND true → true.
Finally false OR true → true.

Part 2 – Type Conversion

Q5: Find the output and explain:
console.log("5" + 2);
console.log("5" - 2);
console.log("5" * 2);
console.log("5" / 2);


Output:
52
3
10
2.5
Explanation:
+ joins string and number.
Other operators convert string into number automatically.

Q6: Convert the following using explicit conversion:
let value = "100";
- Convert to Number
- Convert to Boolean

Answer:
let value = "100";
console.log(Number(value));
console.log(Boolean(value));
Output:
100
true

Explanation:
String "100" is converted to number.
Non-empty string always gives true.

Q7: What will be the output?
console.log(Boolean(""));
console.log(Boolean(" "));
console.log(Boolean(0));
console.log(Boolean([]));
Explain why.

Output:
false
true
false
true
Explanation:
Empty string and 0 are false values.
Space string and array are considered true.

PART 3 – Conditional Statements

Q8: Write a program:
If marks >= 90 → Grade A
If marks >= 75 → Grade B
If marks >= 50 → Grade C
Else → Fail
Use if else if.

Answer: 
let marks = 78;
if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade B");
} else if (marks >= 50) {
  console.log("Grade C");
} else {
  console.log("Fail");
}
Output:
Grade B
Explanation:
78 is greater than 75 but less than 90.

Q9: Traffic Signal Program using switch case:
"red" → Stop
"yellow" → Ready
"green" → Go
Default → Invalid Signal

Answer:
let signal = "green";
switch (signal) {
  case "red":
    console.log("Stop");
    break;
  case "yellow":
    console.log("Ready");
    break;
  case "green":
    console.log("Go");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid Signal");
}
Output:
Go
Explanation:
Green signal means go.

Q10 (Nested If): Check eligibility:
Age >= 18
Height >= 160
Weight >= 50
If all true → "Selected"
Else → show which condition failed.

Answer:
let age = 20;
let height = 165;
let weight = 48;

if (age >= 18) {
  if (height >= 160) {
    if (weight >= 50) {
      console.log("Selected");
    } else {
      console.log("Weight condition failed");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Height condition failed");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Age condition failed");
}
Output:
Weight condition failed
Explanation:
Age and height are correct but weight is less than required.

Output:
Weight condition failed
Explanation:
Age and height are correct but weight is less than required.

Part 4 – Loops

Q11: Print numbers from 1 to 20 using for loop

Answer: 
for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
Output:
1 2 3 ... 20
Explanation:
Loop runs from 1 to 20 and prints each number.

Q12: Print only odd numbers from 1 to 20.

Answer:
for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  if (i % 2 !== 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
Output:
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
Explanation:
Odd numbers give remainder 1 when divided by 2.

Q13: Using while loop:
Print numbers from 10 to 1

Answer:
let i = 10;
while (i >= 1) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}
Output:

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation:
Loop decreases value until condition becomes false.

Q14: Using do-while loop:
Print numbers from 1 to 5.

Answer:
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);
Output:
1 2 3 4 5
Explanation:
Do-while executes at least once before checking condition.

Q15: Using for-of loop:
Print each character from:
let word = "STACKLY"

Answer:
let word = "STACKLY";

for (let ch of word) {
  console.log(ch);
}
Output:
S T A C K L Y
Explanation:
for-of is used to access each character in a string.

Q16: Using for-in loop:
Print both key and value from:
let student = {
name: "Arun",
course: "MERN",
duration: "6 months"
}

Answer:
let student = {
  name: "Arun",
  course: "MERN",
  duration: "6 months"
};

for (let key in student) {
  console.log(key + " : " + student[key]);
}
Output:
name : Arun
course : MERN
duration : 6 months
Explanation:
for-in loop is used to access object keys and values.
